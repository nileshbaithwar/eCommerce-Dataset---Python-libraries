# Data Analysis and Visualization using Python

## Overview
This project performs **data analysis and visualization** on an **eCommerce dataset** using popular **Python libraries**. The dataset contains sales information across multiple channels, products, and customer demographics, including age group, gender, and geographic location (cities and states).

The project demonstrates how to extract valuable insights from the dataset by leveraging Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes sales data for an eCommerce platform, with the following attributes:
- **Product Information**: Product category, product name, SKU, and pricing details.
- **Sales Data**: Information about the number of units sold, revenue, discounts, and sales channels.
- **Customer Demographics**: Age group and gender of customers.
- **Geographical Data**: Sales broken down by cities and states.
- **Sales Channel**: Various sales channels like online, in-store, etc.

### Dataset Columns:
- `Product ID`
- `Product Category`
- `Product Name`
- `Units Sold`
- `Revenue`
- `Discount Applied`
- `Age Group`
- `Gender`
- `City`
- `State`
- `Sales Channel`

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization (static plots).
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization (enhanced plots).
- **Plotly**: Interactive charts and dashboards.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **GeoPandas** (if used for mapping): Geospatial data visualization.

## Python Visualizations
This project uses Python to create the following types of visualizations:
1. **Sales Performance by Product**: Bar charts and histograms to display the sales performance (units sold and revenue) for each product.
2. **Sales by Channel**: Pie charts and stacked bar charts to visualize sales distribution by different channels (online vs. in-store, etc.).
3. **Demographic Insights**: Interactive visualizations to explore sales by age group and gender.
4. **Geographical Insights**: Maps to display sales across various cities and states using **Plotly** or **GeoPandas**.
5. **Sales Trends Over Time**: Line plots showing sales trends over time, segmented by product, age group, gender, or sales channel.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and preprocessing the data for analysis.
- **Aggregated Metrics**: Calculating and displaying total sales, average revenue per product, and sales trends.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Using **Plotly** to create interactive dashboards with filters for dynamic exploration.
- **Geospatial Visualizations**: Mapping sales performance by city and state.
- **Statistical Insights**: Visualizations to show the correlation between factors like discount applied and sales performance.
